  "desc": "Expanding on prior VidSum work to apply research ML algorithms to UAV video in quasi-real time, VidSumm Web is a tool to allow novice users to run and view the results from those preconfigured algorithms on curated datasets in the system. My contribution primarily revolved around the Docker Python SDK, responsible for launching, monitoring, and providing output from the configured ML algorithms.",

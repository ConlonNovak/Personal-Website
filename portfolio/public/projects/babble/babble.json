Prototyped on Android with Android Beam (to transfer the APK in under a minute to another phone), Android Nearby Connections (to create a mesh network of peer-to-peer bluetooth, wi-fi P2P, and NFC connections for messaging), and MongoDB Stitch (to upload messages to the cloud whenever a device in the network does go online).",
